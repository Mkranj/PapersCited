Text in English
This is a work by AuthorOne (2022). If there were multiple, it would be AuthorFirst and AuthorSecond (1999). Citing also works in this format (AuthorSecond & AuthorThird, 1999). Note that AuthorSecond and AuthorThird (1999) won't be listed twice if the format is changed.  AuthorThird (1999) can also have a solo work. And AuthorThird (1999) and AuthorFourth (1999) register correctly, even though they are preceded by „and“. The first one also gets suggested as "And AuthorThird" since both word are capitalized.
One can also list multiple works by certain authors (ProlificAuthor 2007, 2008a, 2010).   Spacey(1999) has several spaces in front of it and no space before parenthesis, but registers as a citation. It is recorded with no space between name and year, which is useful to let you know you need to correct that in the text itself! ProlificAuthor (2008b) managed to write another paper in the meantime.
When quoting exact pages, „the author should still be recognised“ (Writerly, 2001, p. 183).
In 1989 is an example of a phrase that looks similar to a citation, but isn't, and shouldn't be detected as one. The 1999 study further exemplified the importance of such filtering.

Ovo je .docx proba (Genius i Brainiac, 2008; Kolege i sur. 1999). Ako brainiac (2008, str. 92) više ne misli kao prije (Brainiac, 2007), tada ni mi (Darko i Bubamarko 2011) ni kolege (Manman i sur. 2022) nemamo što dodati. Čuturić i Čuču (2009) ne bi trebali biti na kraju liste. Šverko i sur. (1989) također. Tijekom 2019 utvrđeno je da se ovaj početak rečenice ne treba smatrati citatom.
Sretno, Lucky i suradnici (2007) i Zanzibar (2011).
