This file contains instructions on installing additional libraries so PapersCited can read more file types.

# .doc files
NOT REQUIRED FOR .docx FILES!

If you get an error reading .doc files on Windows, you need to download Antiword and set it in your PATH environmental variable. Steps adapted from: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51727237/reading-doc-file-in-python-using-antiword-in-windows-also-docx/51727238#51727238

1) Download Antiword from https://www.softpedia.com/get/Office-tools/Other-Office-Tools/Antiword.shtml
2) Extract the downloaded file
3) Move the "antiword" folder into your "C:/" drive, at root level.
4) Now you need to add it to %PATH%. To do so, open the Windows start menu and type "Edit the system environment variables", then select it.
5) On the "Advanced" tab, select "Environment Variables..."
6) One row should be labelled "Path". Select it, and press the "Edit..." button below.
7) On the right side of the window press "New". Paste the following: "C:\antiword".
8) Press "OK".
9) Restart the computer.

With this, you have added the Antiword libraries to your %PATH% variable, so programs, including PapersCited, can access it to manipulate .doc files. 

# .pdf files
The Poppler utility is used to read text from PDF files. It can be installed on Windows
in a few steps. PapersCited is tested using Poppler 23.08.0, so the links will reflect that.

1) Download Release-23.08.0-0.zip from the following Github link: https://github.com/oschwartz10612/poppler-windows/releases/tag/v23.08.0-0
2) Extract the archive using a tool like 7zip.
3) Move the *"poppler-23.08.0"* folder to "C:\Program Files"
4) Now you need to add it to %PATH%. To do so, open the Windows start menu and type "Edit the system environment variables", then select it.
5) On the "Advanced" tab, select "Environment Variables..."
6) One row should be labelled "Path". Select it, and press the "Edit..." button below.
7) Press "New" and paste the following: "C:\Program Files\poppler-23.08.0\Library\bin"
8) Press "OK".
9) Restart the computer for the changes to take effect.
